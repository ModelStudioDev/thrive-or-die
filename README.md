# Thrive or Die

**Thrive or Die** is a survival management game set in a post-apocalyptic world overrun by zombies. The player takes the role of a survivor colony leader and must manage resources, citizens, buildings, and hostile events to ensure the settlement’s survival and growth.

## 🧠 Concept

In 2030, a global pandemic wiped out most of humanity. The virus does not simply kill—it takes control of the brain even after death, creating real zombies.

You are one of the few remaining survivors and the leader of a growing colony. Your goal is not to *win*, but to **survive as long as possible** by expanding your base, managing your people, and facing increasingly dangerous threats.

There is no traditional *game over screen*: poor decisions will slowly lead to the collapse of your settlement.

---

## 🔁 Core Loop

1. Collect resources
2. Build and expand the settlement
3. Assign and manage citizens
4. Face dynamic events (hordes, raids, sickness)
5. Improve efficiency and grow

This loop repeats with increasing difficulty as the colony becomes larger and more attractive to threats.

## 🏗️ Core Gameplay

- Free building placement (inspired by *Clash of Clans*)
- Full colony management from an isometric view
- Assign citizens to buildings and tasks
- External exploration with risk/reward mechanics
- Research system to unlock new buildings
- Demolish and reorganize existing structures

---

## 👥 Citizens & Stats

Citizens are the core of the colony. Each one contributes through specific skills:

- **Intelligence** – Research, medicine, food production
- **Combat** – Fighting, defense, weapon mastery
- **Building** – Construction and repairs
- **Scavenger** – Exploration, faster travel, loot quality
- **Strength** – Carrying capacity and physical resistance

Skills improve over time based on assigned tasks and buildings.

---

## 📦 Resources

- **Food & Water** – Passively consumed by citizens
- **Wood** – Basic construction material
- **Scrap** – Advanced construction material
- **Time** – Required for building and research
- **Research Points** – Generated by laboratories to unlock new content

Resources must be stored and protected, as enemies may attempt to steal or destroy them.

---

## ⚠️ Threats & Events

The colony will face constant dangers, including:

- **Hunger & Dehydration** – Leads to weakness and death
- **Zombies** – Attack in hordes and can infect citizens
- **Raiders** – Organized human groups attacking the base
- **Sickness** – Reduces productivity and may cause death
- **Citizens Leaving** – Poor living conditions can cause desertion
- **Infection Spread** – Infected citizens may contaminate others

---

## 🎮 Game Flow

Each session, the player decides how to prioritize actions:

- Resource gathering
- Construction and upgrades
- Research
- Event management
- Optimization and reorganization

Efficient planning and time management are key to long-term survival.
